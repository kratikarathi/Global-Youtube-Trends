From this project, we hope to learn about some of the factors that may or may not be correlated with each other in the Youtube space.
With the large amount of creators and video uploads, this dataset can give interesting insights into Youtube video trends, metrics, user
behaviour, and more. This information can be beneficial for creators, businesses, and users. The main intended audience would be
creators, advertising companies and brand makers. Understanding popular content and niches will uncover opportunities for effective
advertising and thus, monetization.
